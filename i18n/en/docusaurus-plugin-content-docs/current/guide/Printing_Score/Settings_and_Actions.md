# Settings & Actions

The selected score in Gesture Performance mode or Auto Play mode can be printed by tapping the Print button on the Home view.

Tapping the Print button <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Printing_Score/printer.svg')} alt="プリントボタン" width="18" height="18" /> opens the "Print Settings" view. After adjusting the settings, tap “Create and Print PDF”.

This opens the AirPrint "Options" view. Select your printer and tap the Print button to print the sheet score.

Note: Currently, printing is only possible on cut sheets. If you selected “Piano Roll(40mm)” or “Piano Roll(70mm)” as the paper type, cut the printed sheet score and connect the pieces to create roll sheet score, as shown in the following video.
