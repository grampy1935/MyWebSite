# Playing Midi Data Directly

Enabling 'Play Midi Data Directly' in 'Score Information' view allows you to assign instruments to each track recorded in the MIDI data and play them.

Turning the toggle on displays the tracks recorded in the MIDI data.

Tapping each track name displays 'Settings' view, where you can set the instrument type, amplitude, and pan(phase) for the target track.

'Instrument Types' can be selected from 57 options, similar to instrument selection in the Home View.

The default value for 'Amplitude' is 0. It can be set in increments of 1 between -90 and 12. Smaller values result in lower amplitude (volume).

The default value for 'Pan' is 0. It can be set in increments of 1 between -10 and 10, specifying the corresponding instrument's position in the stereo speakers. 0 is centered; smaller values position it more to the left, while larger values position it more to the right.

Tap the 'Back' button in the upper left corner to return to the 'Score information' view.

If 'Play Midi Data Directly' is off, the performance will use the instrument selected in the Home View.
