# Selecting Recorded Takes

If you have already saved recordings of your performance, you can use the 'Select a recorded take' feature to choose which takes to use in Auto-Play mode or delete unnecessary takes.

Tap a take name to select it.

Swipe a take name left to reveal a delete button on the right. Tap this button to delete the take.
The original take cannot be deleted.

Note: Selecting recorded takes is also possible from the Home view while in Auto-Play mode.
