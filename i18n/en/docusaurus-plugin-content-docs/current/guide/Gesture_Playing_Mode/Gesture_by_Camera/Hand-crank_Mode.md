Once your device is ready, tap the Settings button from the Home view to display "Settings" view. Turn on “Use” for “GESTURE BY CAMERA,” set the mode to “Hand Crank,” then tap the “Back” button to return to the Home view.

If set up correctly, a red circle 🔴 will appear in the center of the screen.

Tap the Play button to start the performance. Rotate the circular mark to play.
