Purchasing the "Using the Camera" In-App purchase enables gesture-based performance using the camera.

Gesture by Camera Performance includes “Conductor" mode using the front camera and “Hand Clank" mode using the rear camera.

“Conductor” mode is a mode where the performance follows the movement of your index finger as you conduct like a conductor.

“Hand Clank" mode recognizes a rotating circular mark detected by the app and plays along with its movement.

You can switch between both modes from the "Settings" view.
