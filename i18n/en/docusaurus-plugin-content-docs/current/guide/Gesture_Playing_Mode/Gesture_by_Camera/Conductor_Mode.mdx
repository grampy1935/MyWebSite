# Conductor Mode

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

To play in Conductor Mode, tap the Settings button <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Settings/slider.horizontal.3.svg')} alt="設定ボタン" width="18" height="18"  /> to display the "Settings" view. Enable “Use” for "GESTURE BY CAMERA", set "Mode" to Conductor, then tap the “Back” button to return to the Home view.

Next, tap the file name to display "Select the Score" view. Tap the edit button to enter edit mode. Then tap the title you wish to play. In the displayed "Score Information" view, enable “Play MIDI Data Directly” and tap the "Back" button to return to "Select the Score" view. Confirm the desired score is selected, then tap the “Back” button to return to the home view.

import WandIcon from '@site/static/img/Gesture_Playing_Mode/wand.and.rays.inverse.svg';

If configured correctly, a wand icon <WandIcon width={18} height={18} style={{ fill: 'red' }} /> will appear in the center of the screen.

Tap the Play button to start the performance. Then, using the note counter displayed in the bottom left corner as a reference, conduct with your index finger like a conductor.

Note: If “Play MIDI Data Directly” remains off, an index finger icon will be displayed. Even if you start the performance, the note counter will not appear, and the performance will follow the rotation of your index finger.
