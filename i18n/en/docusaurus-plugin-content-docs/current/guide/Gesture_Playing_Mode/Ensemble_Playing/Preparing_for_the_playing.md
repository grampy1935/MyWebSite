# Preparing for the Playng

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

First, turn on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in the settings of all iPhones participating in the ensemble performance.

Next, tap the Settings button <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Settings/slider.horizontal.3.svg')} alt="設定ボタン" width="18" height="18"  /> on the Home view, then turn on 'Ensemble Mode' in 'Settings' view that appears.

When you turn on "Ensemble Mode," an option labeled "Leader" will appear. Turn it on to designate a device as the ensemble leader. Only one device can be set as the leader. Operation is not guaranteed if multiple devices are set as leaders.

If “Leader” is off, the device is set as a member. Since ensemble performance is executed via wireless communication, there is a slight time lag before information reaches members from the leader. To compensate for this, adjust the “Hasten Timing” value to correct the delay.

After completing settings, tap the “Back” button to return to the Home View.

Upon returning to the Home View, you will see an icon indicating Ensemble Mode and the number of iPhones participating in the ensemble.

All participants must select the same score containing the parts each will play (Leader and Member parts).
You can assign instruments to each performer by setting the sound “Amplitude” of tracks other than the one you are playing to -90.
