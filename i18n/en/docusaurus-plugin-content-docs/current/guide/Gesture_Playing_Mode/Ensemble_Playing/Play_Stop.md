# Starting and Stopping Performance

Members switch to auto-play mode using the mode button, then tap the play button.

When the leader begins playing with a gesture, ensemble members automatically start playing along with the leader.

Once automatic playback begins, members start their own performance with a gesture at an appropriate timing. When a member begins playing, the screen turns gray, and the white notes they play are displayed overlaid on the automatically played black notes. At this point, if the member's performance is behind, the white note appears above the black note. Conversely, if ahead, the white note appears below the black note.

This allows members to visually confirm whether their playing is behind or ahead of the leader's performance. By controlling their own tempo to ensure the white notes align as closely as possible with the black notes, they can achieve ensemble playing that matches the leader's timing and tempo.
