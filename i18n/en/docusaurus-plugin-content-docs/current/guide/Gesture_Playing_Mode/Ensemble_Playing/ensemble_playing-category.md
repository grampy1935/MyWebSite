Ensemble Performance is a performance mode where one iPhone is set as the ensemble leader, and other iPhones are set as ensemble members. Members play along with the leader's performance. Members see both the leader's performance and their own performance displayed overlaid on the screen, allowing them to match their timing while watching the screen.
