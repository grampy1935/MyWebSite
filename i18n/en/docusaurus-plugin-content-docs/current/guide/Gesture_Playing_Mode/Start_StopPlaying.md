# Starting and Stopping the Performance

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Tap the play button  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Gesture_Playing_Mode/play.fill.svg')} alt="演奏ボタン" width="18" height="18" />to start the performance.


Draw a clockwise circle on the iPhone screen with a single finger to move the sheet score.

Slow circles play slowly; fast circles play quickly.

Large circles play loudly; small circles play softly.

Drawing in the opposite direction reverses playback.

To stop the performance, tap the stop button  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Gesture_Playing_Mode/stop.fill.svg')} alt="停止ボタン" width="18" height="18"  /> .

Tip💡
If it doesn't rotate smoothly, we recommend using a touch pen with a transparent disc tip. Wrapping aluminum foil around your finger can also help.
