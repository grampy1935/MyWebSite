# Score Selection

Purchasing the “MIDI file import” enables you to import MIDI files from external sources.

Imported MIDI files can be selected from 'Select the score' view, which appears when you tap a sheet music title in the Home View.

Tapping any score name in the list selects that score, and 'Select the score' view automatically closes.

You can also search for score using the search bar at the top.

import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';

Tips💡
You can create MIDI files yourself using applications like MuseScore. This app verifies functionality using files exported from MuseScore.
