# In-App Purchase

Tap “Purchase and Restore” under “In-App Purchases” in the "Settings" view to display the "In-App Purchases" view. You can purchase each of the two features—“MIDI file import” and “Using the camera”—by tapping them individually.

Purchased items will show a checkmark on the left.

If purchased items appear as unpurchased after reinstalling the app, you can restore them by tapping the “Restore” button.
