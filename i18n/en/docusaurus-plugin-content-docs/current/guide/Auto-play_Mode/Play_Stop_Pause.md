# Start/Stop/Pause Playing

First, select the score you wish to play. If you have already recorded the selected score using gestures, a take number will also appear next to or below the score name. Please select the take number as well.

Tap the Play button <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Gesture_Playing_Mode/play.fill.svg')} alt="演奏ボタン" width="18" height="18" /> to start automatic playback, and tap the Stop button <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/Gesture_Playing_Mode/stop.fill.svg')} alt="停止ボタン" width="18" height="18" /> to stop playback.

Double-tap the screen during playback to pause. Double-tap again to resume playback.

While paused, perform a single-finger gesture to enable manual playback via gestures.
