# Preparing Sheet Score and Devices  

To play in Hand-Crank Performance Mode, you need sheet score that can be read by the rear camera and a device to send the sheet score.  

Currently, sheet score can be either 40mm/70mm wide roll sheet score or disc sheet score, which can be printed on plain paper from the app.

Devices for sending sheet score include commercially available hand-cranked music boxes, hand-cranked musical toys, and rotating platforms.
