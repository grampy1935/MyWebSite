# Preparing for the performance 

Switching to Hand-Crank Play Mode activates the rear camera, displaying the camera feed in the score view.

Once the image appears, position your iPhone to capture the sheet score, ensuring both lines on either side of the score are within the frame.

At this point, you can zoom in or out using a two-finger pinch gesture within the score view.

Similarly, you can adjust the focus using a rotation gesture.

Once the camera frame is set and the focus is adjusted, you are ready to perform.
